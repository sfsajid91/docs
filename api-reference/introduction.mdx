## What is web scraping & web automation?

**Web scraping** is getting structured data from websites. For example, if you want to gather all your favorite blogs from a site that doesn't offer an API, web scraping becomes useful. It enables you to collect data directly from online sources.

**And web automation** is performing different web actions automatically. It could be filling out a form, searching for something on the internet, or maybe you want to compare prices across different e-commerce websites.

## Welcome

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
