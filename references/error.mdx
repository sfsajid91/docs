Errors in the ScrapeAutomate API may occur due to invalid options, internal issues, or when the credit limit is reached. Whenever an error occurs, the API provides a clear and descriptive error message to help identify the problem.

## Example Error Response

Here is an example of an error response when no API key is provided:

```http Error Response

GET 'https://app.scrapeautomate.com/api/scraper?api_key=[OPTIONS]'

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
vary: RSC, Next-Router-State-Tree, Next-Router-Prefetch
content-type: application/json
Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2025 12:10:33 GMT
Connection: close
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

{
  "success": false,
  "message": "User with that API key not found!",
  "errorCode": "api_key_invalid",
  "stack": "Error: User with that API key not found"
}

```

## Error Response Structure

Each error response includes:

- `errorCode`: A string key for precise categorization of the error.
- `message`: A detailed description of the error.
- `stack`: The stack trace of the error (included only in development mode).
- `status`: The HTTP status code associated with the error.

## Common Error Codes

The API uses standardized error codes to indicate various error conditions. Here's a comprehensive list of error codes you might encounter:
